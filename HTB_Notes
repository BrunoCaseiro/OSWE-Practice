Notes from IppSec's walkthroughs of the HTB machines I don't have access to :(

Vault
  - For a fully stable shell --> python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")' --> CTRL + Z --> ssty raw -echo --> fg --> export TERM=xterm
  - You can remote port forward in order to recieve a shell on your machine that is only available internally (send reverse shell to ssh user, which forwards the connection to your attacker machine)
    --> ssh -R 127.0.0.1:9001:127.0.0.1:9001
  - You can bypass firewalls with the flag --source-port x in nmap. For example, if the firewall is blocking everything except DNS (port 53), try nmap ...... --source-port 53

Popcorn
  - You can test for virtual hosts by intercepting requests and changing the Host header

Celestial
  - Pretty straightforward. NodeJS deserialization in the cookie was pretty cool to see, but nothing extraordinary
