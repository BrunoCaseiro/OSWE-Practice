Notes from IppSec's walkthroughs of the HTB machines I don't have access to :(

Vault
  - For a fully stable shell --> python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")' --> CTRL + Z --> ssty raw -echo --> fg --> export TERM=xterm
  - You can remote port forward in order to recieve a shell on your machine that is only available internally (root reverse shell contacts User, which forwards the connection to your attacker machine)
    --> ssh -R 127.0.0.1:9001:127.0.0.1:9001
